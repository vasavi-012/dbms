<h1><u><center>Abstract</center></u></h1>

<p style="font-size:25px;">The knowledge and understanding of quality standards of guests helps hotel managers improve 
the quality of hotel services and increase guests’ satisfaction with the hotel stay. Different 
aspects of a hotel offer participate in the guests’ evaluation of the hotel experience. The factors 
that influence guests’ satisfaction level are also named “hotel attributes”. There exist a large 
number of factors that influence guests’ impressions, but certainly not all of them have the same 
level of importance for guests. In order to be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their 
businesses, hotel management has to identify which improvements in the hotel operations can 
bring additional value to their guests. One of the most reliable information sources for gaining 
customer knowledge is undoubtedly the feedback provided directly from customers. If analyzed 
properly, it can be exploited for the purpose of improving the hotel operations and raising profits. 
The environment in which hospitality businesses operate nowadays has become radically 
connected to the use of the Internet. An increase in the usage of Social Media triggered extreme 
changes in the information channels that hotel guests use in order to make booking decisions. 
Hence, the hotel management should be aware that travel information websites present a 
valuable source of information about customer preferences. They offer service providers a 
possibility to have an insight into the reasons for satisfaction or disappointment of their guests. 
The aim of this thesis is to examine the relationship between different hotel attributes and the 
guests’ overall satisfaction with the hotel stay. It tries to uncover the most influential hotel 
attributes for the formation of guests’ satisfaction.</p>
